## Bozhidar's Emacs config

This repo contains my personal Emacs configuration. I don't advise
people to use it directly and I won't be accepting pull requests
(after all that's my config, right?).

I'm putting it here mostly as a source of inspiration. :-)

If you're looking for a nice (and way better structured) setup, check out
my [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) project.
