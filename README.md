## Bozhidar's Emacs config

This repo contains my personal Emacs configuration. I don't advise
people to use it directly and I won't be accepting pull requests
(after all that's my config, right?).

I'm putting it here mostly as a source of inspiration. :-)

In the unlikely event that you'd like to use my setup directly you can do so like this:

``` shellsession
$ ln -s ~/projects/emacs.d/init.el .emacs.d/init.el
```

The above assumes you've cloned the repo under `~/projects`.

If you're looking for a nice (and way better structured) setup, check out
my [Prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) project.
